manageAssessmentTypesForm.html - Gradebook (DOS Implementation)

This page will serve as a form for data collection to collect the data that is needed to filter the assessment items that are included in the course and section that the instructor wants to make changes to.  This page will contain several selection menus to collect the data from the end user. The data that the user will have the option to choose will be dynamcially filled in from data filtered from the DBMS.

Using the selection menus increases the security of the application because it means the end user cannot enter in their own data that will be interpreted badly and cause malicious actions to be preformed on the DB.

Once the user is finished filling in all of the data then they will need to press a submit button which will take all of the data that the user picked and process it into the DBMS as a query to load the next set of results for the next page if all of the selection menus have an option filled in. If all of the options are not filled in then there will be a dialog box that states that there are one or more fields missing and will keep everything all filled in.

In summary, This page is set as a form data collection page to simplify the UI for the actual management of Assessments page.

The page will have 3 tabs at the top of the page:
	1. View/Manage Student Grades
	2. Manage Assessment Types & Items (This form page which will eventially lead to the page this form describes)
	3. Logout

NOTES:
* The institution name can be changed as needed for the institution that will be using this product
* After the submit button is pressed, the site should take the information that is gathered by this form and pass it to a JS function that will process the query with the DBMS and then return a list of Assessment types to a selection menu on the page manageAssessmentTypes.html

NOTE: These 2 pages will share the same javascript file because the files are sharing the same sort of functionality

		        This section is here to allow the instructor to filter which year, season,  course, section and assessment type that they want to manage the assessment items for.

		        This section improves the security of the program because it adds more selection from the user which will make it less likely that the end user could insert bad queries into the DBMS which will make it less likely that the end user could end up causing malicious damage to the system.

		        Fields that can be dynamically populated before the instructor starts making selections:
		            * Year

		        Fields that depend on other needed data:
			    * Season - Depends on the year
		            * Course - Depends on year and season
		            * Section - Depends on year, season, and course
