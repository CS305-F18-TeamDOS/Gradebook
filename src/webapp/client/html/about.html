This is the About page for the Gradebook application. All of the information on this page with the acception of  the note about the revision of the application and its requirements is taken from the original Gradebook application.

The page will have 3 tabs at the top of the page:
	1. A tab that will bring you to the login page.
	2. A tab that will keep you on the About page.
	3. A Change Log page that will describe the changes made from the existing implementation of Gradebook to the DOS implementation.


NOTES:
* The institution name can be changed as needed for the institution that will be using this product

		        <h2>About Gradebook</h2>
		        <p>Gradebook is an open-source product for instructors to record student
		 assessment and attendance. It is developed at the Data Science &amp;
		 Systems Lab (<a href="https://dassl.github.io" target="_blank">DASSL</a>
		 , read <em>dazzle</em>) at the Western Connecticut State University 
		 (<a href="http://wcsu.edu/" target="_blank">WCSU</a>).</p>
		 <p>This implementation has been revised by Members of Team DOS: Kyle Bella, Kenneth Kozlowski and Joseph Tether for a term project in CS305-71 at WCSU.</p>
		        <h5>Goals</h5>
		        <p>Gradebook is developed with the following goals:</p>
		        <ol>
			        <li>Provide instructors a free, open, and modern tool to record 
			 student assessment and attendance</li>
			        <li>Provide instructors a framework to surface, analyze, and visualize
			 patterns in student performance</li>
			        <li>Use (and demonstrate the use of) modern tools and processes in
			 software and data engineering</li>
			        <li>Provide Computer Science students a real-life application to
			 develop and maintain as both curricular and co-curricular activity</li>
			        <li>Provide Computer Science students a framework to experience
			 first-hand topics such as: web and mobile application development;
			 RESTful APIs; multi-tenancy; scalability; and cloud-based services.</li>
		        </ol>
		        <h5>Status</h5>
		        <p>Gradebook is still in early stages of development (“alpha stage”).
		 Much of its external documentation is in the form of README files
		 contained in various directories within the product repository. The
		 source code is commented reasonably well. More information about Gradebook
		 can be found by visiting its
		        <a href="https://github.com/DASSL/Gradebook" target="_blank"> repository
		 on GitHub</a>.</p>
		        <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Because the product is still in very early
		 stages of development, it should not be used as a production system in
		 its current state. There are no guarantees that future development
		 releases will provide any kind of backward compatibility or portability.</p>
		        <h5>Contributors</h5>
		        <p>Gradebook was conceived by and is designed by 
		 <a href="http://sites.wcsu.edu/murthys/" target="_blank">Sean Murthy</a>,
		 a member of the Computer Science faculty at WCSU.</p>
		        <p>The following undergraduate Computer Science students at WCSU
		 contribute(d) to the development of Gradebook:</p>
